/**
 * The base class for any presenter displaying the children of an entity. Presenters that extend this class directly
 * usually display a table of possible children, with add or remove buttons allowing the collection of children
 * held by the parent to be modified.
 * <p/>
 * Even though the child of a parent is the same database entity as the child in the list of potential children,
 * the REST interface wraps up the relationship in a specific type. This is done so the list of children will
 * include any relationship information, like sorting e.g. Parent -> Child Collection -> Child and Relationship Info.
 * This is opposed to having a list of relationship types that then hold a reference to the child itself
 * e.g. Parent -> Child Collection -> Relationship Info -> Child.
 * <p/>
 * This manifests itself in the generic types defined by this class: A, B and C are the types that represent the potential children (i.e. the "raw" list
 * of entities from the table that holds the entities that can be attached as children); D, E and F are the types
 * that represent the children of the parent entity.
 *
 * @param <T> The entity type
 * @param <C> The collection item type for potential children
 * @param <D> The existing child type
 * @param <E> The collection type for entity D
 * @param <F> The collection item type for entity D
